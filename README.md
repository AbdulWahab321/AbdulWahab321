# My Tech Journey
As a 15-year-old, I began exploring the wilderness of the technology at the age of 13, creating small projects along the way to sharpen the knowledge in programming, delving through new technologies and testing them out, jumping from one language to another. 

# Current Focus and Approach
My primary language is Python, I always try to learn something new in my programming journey. Trying to stay up to date with the rapidly evolving technology

# Technologies I have explored
### Introduction
At first I was learning ethical hacking by following free courses available in YouTube, but then Programming caught my attention so I started learning Programming.

### HTML/Javascript/CSS
- Random small websites using this combination and p5js
- Created a basic angry birds game
- Margray2d documentation
- A simple website that I used to store some school notes

### Python
- Started off by creating a small and really basic Virus Creator (using metasploit) 
- Created some small CLI projects for myself
- Created small games like Space shooter using Pygame and a Sand Simulation
- Created some small libraries like hyperDataS, pyml, Margray2d
- Experimented with Computer vision project called Ai air keyboard using cv2
- Learning PyQt5 by creating a basic Notepad and then a basic Code editor

### Javascript, Nodejs
- Random small projects using react native and expo
- Vite and react
- Experimented with Nextjs 

### Dart and Flutter
- Experimented with it and eventually lost complete interest in it

### C++
- Created a simple sand simulation using SDL2

### Godot
- Attempted to create a 3d game inspired by open world games (specifically Skyrim) but eventually quit working on it due to my lack of skill in 3D modelling and arts

### Rust
- Still learning, on the pretty basics
- Currently working on creating a code editor called "QuarkEdit" using Tauri, Typescript, Vite, React

## Future Plans
- Master Rust
- Learn Machine learning & Deep learning
